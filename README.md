# Spring Boot Learning Path for Experienced .NET Developers (As suggeested by Co-pilot)

---

## Overview

If you have 20 years of C#/.NET experience like me, you can become productive in Spring Boot in **2–4 weeks**, at least the github copilot thinks so :). This guide prepared by Copilot, provides a structured learning path, recommended resources, and a checklist to track your progress. I will try to follow it and see if it is beneficial.
